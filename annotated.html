        <h3>Open letter from Queen Mary University of London PhD students to Colin Bailey (Principal), Andrew
            Livingstone (VP for Research) and Adrian Armstrong (Director, Doctoral College)</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            On 29/05/2020, we the QMUL PhD Pandemic Organising Group sent an [<a href="https://www.qmul-phd.com">OPEN
                LETTER</a>] to
            Colin Bailey (President and Principal), Adrian Armstrong (Director, Doctoral College) and Andrew Livingston
            (Vice Principal, Research and Innovation).
        </p>
        <p>
            A week later, we received a [<a
                href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/doctoralcollege/media/doctoral-college/documents/PhD-student-response.pdf">RESPONSE</a>].
            We were incredibly dissatisfied with this reply, and decided to express this through a line-by-line
            assessment with
            corrections, which we present to you below:

                <p>Hi Colin, Andrew, and Adrian: Good work in submitting a response!</p>
                <p>
                    We noticed quite a number of errors, omissions, and concerning issues within this text. Since most
                    of us are without teaching for the foreseeable future and are certain that you're very busy given
                    the numerous open letters and social media campaigns pointing to QMUL's disastrous leadership during
                    this time, we thought we would take time to support you. See below for corrections and suggestions
                    that will help you turn this into a viable response statement. Don't be disheartened, we are sure
                    you can do it! We look forward to seeing your re-submitted response promptly.
                </p>
