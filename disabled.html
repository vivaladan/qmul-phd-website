                <p><b>Dear Adrian Armstrong, Sandra Eldridge, Rainbow Murray, Richard Pickersgill, Kate Malleson, and Sheila Gupta</b></p>
                <p>Cc: Lauren Day, Disabled and SLD Rep, QMSU</p>
                <h4><u>QMUL policy for PhD funded extensions with specific regards to PhD students with disabilities</u></h4>
                <p>
                    We are writing to you to express our deep concern that the current QMUL policy regarding funded extensions 
                    for PhD students in relation to the impact of COVID-19, according to the 2010 Equality Act, discriminates 
                    against PhD students with disabilities (including physical disabilities, long term health conditions, mental 
                    illnesses and disorders, SpLDs, neurodivergencies). We remind you that the pandemic, and subsequent lack 
                    of university policy, is disproportionately impacting, and in some cases actively harming, PhD students with 
                    disabilities. We urge you to take immediate action on this situation as delaying action might cause further 
                    harm to PhD students with disabilities.
                </p>
                <h5>Lack of Action from QMUL </h5>
                <p>
                    Disabled PhD students have not been informed about a separate - or indeed any - policy for funded extensions 
                    at QMUL. Many current PhD students at QMUL, from a variety of departments and schools, have previously written 
                    to the Doctoral College and senior management regarding the discriminatory nature, albeit indirect, of a ‘blind’ 
                    case-by-case approach for an arbitrarily selected group of students. To be clear, the request for funded 
                    extensions for PhD students with disabilities is a request for reasonable adjustments.
                </p>
                <h5>Institutional Precedents</h5>
                <p>
                    UKRI recently <a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/students-and-training-grants/">announced</a> that any mental or physical health issue brought on or exacerbated by the pandemic 
                    and lockdown, should now be considered within cases for COVID-19 costed extensions, and separately from PhDs 
                    usual sick leave allocations, and that requirements around doctor’s notes should also be relaxed. QMUL’s senior 
                    management has repeatedly stated that they are following UKRI’s lead on forming its approach to funded extensions. 
                    As such, we expect these considerations and allowances to be put into action at this university, and we urge you 
                    to act upon these concerns immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Coventry University, ‘Extensions to thesis submission dates have been granted to those PGR that have requested 
                    them’. Russell Group member University of Manchester have stipulated that PhDs can apply for funded extensions 
                    regarding ‘Specific impact resulting from remote working as a result of a disability or any other protected 
                    characteristics’.

                <h5>Precedents from Regulatory Bodies</h5>
                <p>
                    Regulatory body, The Office for Students (OfS) stated in their 
                    <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/media/f351a739-6cd6-4310-8f98-a6aa603f17f4/quality-and-standards-guidance-during-coronavirus.pdf">guidance</a> 
                    dated 3rd April 2020 that: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‘Providers should particularly consider the needs and requirements of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vulnerable students and students from underrepresented groups, particularly in terms of access to resources, equipment and facilities to study.</li>
                    <li>Students suffering from health problems relating to coronavirus or who now have additional caring responsibilities.</li>
                    <li>Students who are also designated as key workers during the coronavirus crisis. </li>
                    <li>Students with specific learning difficulties who may be disadvantaged by an alternative approach to teaching or assessment.</li>
                    <li>Students across different subject groups.</li>
                    <li>Students in their final year of study.’</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Reasonable Adjustments</h5>
                <p>
                    Disability Rights UK (DRUK) <a href="https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/understanding-equality-act-information-disabled-students#:~:text=The%20Equality%20Act%20harmonises%20the,Eliminate%20discrimination%2C%20harassment%20and%20victimisation.">states</a> 
                    that, with regard to the Equality Act, ‘There is no justification for failing 
                    to make a reasonable adjustment’. DRUK also states that ‘Education providers and employers can only make 
                    adjustments if they would be ‘reasonably expected to know’ you have a disability. This means that they should 
                    take reasonable steps to find out if you are disabled.’ 
                </p>
                <p>
                    QMUL can reasonably be expected to know which of its PhD students are disabled and which of its PhD students are 
                    currently awaiting diagnosis or confirmation of DSA via their registration with the Disability and Dyslexia 
                    Services (DDS). QMUL has not contacted disabled students to inform them of what reasonable adjustments are 
                    being made with regard to anticipatory duty. The responsibility to do so lies with the institution, not with 
                    specialist services, such as DDS, nor with individual members of staff. Informing PhD students that they can 
                    continue to access existing resources and services provided by the DDS and the Advice and Counselling Services, 
                    who are not currently able to expand their services, is neither a provision of support given the current context, 
                    nor a reasonable adjustment. It is also unclear which of the Advice and Counselling Services are available to 
                    International and EU/EEA PhD students, or to those currently based outside of the UK. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The obligations of universities to students under the Equality Act do not change as a result of the pandemic. 
                    The Office for Students (OfS) has said ‘that providers should ensure that their approach to making reasonable 
                    adjustments to assessment arrangements for students with a disability remain appropriate and effective in the 
                    current environment.’  
                </p>
                <h5>Anticipatory Duty</h5>
                <p>
                    Disability Rights UK (DRUK) states that ‘For education and service providers, the duty to make reasonable 
                    adjustments is a duty owed to disabled people generally, regardless of whether the provider knows that a 
                    particular student is disabled or whether they have any disabled students at all. This means that they must 
                    plan ahead for reasonable adjustments and not wait for you to approach them before considering how to meet the
                    duty. They must anticipate the type of barriers that students with various impairments may face. They must also 
                    anticipate the adjustments they can make to remove these barriers’. Since PhD students are having to contact 
                    the university about reasonable adjustments, and not the other way around, QMUL is currently failing in its 
                    anticipatory duty to PhDs with disabilities.  
                </p>
                <h5>Discriminatory Issues Regarding the ‘QMUL PGR Covid-19 stipend funding extensions application form and process’</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A further issue for disabled PhD students is the burden of additional administration. The existing Research 
                        Degrees Office extensions form (‘Request to extend writing up period and/or maximum period of registration’) 
                        has not been altered in light of the pandemic. Applying for extensions this way is currently the only recourse 
                        for any kind of ‘support’ for PhDs, with the burden of undertaking this being put on students. This form asks 
                        for an extensive amount of documentation, including completed and draft chapters, and a timeline for completion - 
                        exactly the kind of documents PhD students are unable to produce under current circumstances. Once (and if) 
                        such extensions are granted, disabled PhD students are each then having to reapply for DSAs. It is alarming 
                        that in light of the pandemic, the existing extensions form has not been brought into line with the new QMUL 
                        Covid-19 Funding Request form; the latter of which is substantially shorter than the existing extensions form, 
                        and does not require the submission of additional documentation. This is asking all PhD students that need an 
                        extension to do more work for less. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The use of ‘blind’ applications and excluding disabled PhD students not in 3rd year of funding is indirect 
                        discrimination. According to DRUK, ‘‘indirect discrimination’ is when there is a practice, policy or rule which 
                        applies to everyone in the same way but has a worse effect on some people than others.’
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The form gives, as examples of ‘Different reasons for disruption’, ‘ lack of access to research resources and 
                        facilities, interruption of data collection and/or fieldwork, increased caring responsibilities, affected health 
                        and wellbeing, or other factors’ and states that these ‘will carry equal weight in the discussion of extensions.’ 
                        There is no reference whatsoever to disability. 
                    </li>                    
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h5>Recommendations for Reasonable Adjustments for Disabled PhD students</h5>
                <p>
                    Reasonable adjustments for disabled PhD students at QMUL include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Automatic extensions for all PhDs students with disabilities (i.e. it should not be a requirement on individual 
                        students to apply for extensions). This should include part-time students and students in their writing up year. 
                        Automatic extensions should be open to review given that there is no way of knowing when things will return to normal. 
                        QMUL has this week <a href="http://hr.qmul.ac.uk/voluntary-options-for-staff/">stated that</a> ‘there is at 
                        present no end in sight to the pandemic’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Funded extensions provided to all PhDs with disabilities, regardless of what year of their PhD they are in. 
                        Again, students should not be required to ‘apply’ for such funds. Again, this funding should be open to review 
                        and renewal given the present uncertainties. These funds should be available to part-time students and students 
                        in their writing up year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The immediate provision of funds for PhDs with disabilities to purchase laptops, peripherals, books, printers 
                        and printer consumables, and any other material resources that they require to work under the current conditions. 
                        PhDs with disabilities should not be expected to use their DSA provision for this purpose as these are not 
                        normal circumstances. The existing library policy of only purchasing books not already held by the library is 
                        largely inadequate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The inclusion in all of the above of PhDs not currently registered and/or diagnosed as ‘disabled’ but who may be 
                        going through the process of getting a diagnosis or awaiting confirmation of DSA from SfE. Furthermore, not all home 
                        students with disabilities are automatically eligible for DSA, and international PhD students with disabilities are 
                        ineligible for DSA provision. These students should be included in any QMUL policy for funded extensions for disabled PhDs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We note that the Disabled Students’ Commission, organised by the Office for Students, recently collected information from 
                    disabled university students across the country to make a series of recommendations to the government for they can best be 
                    supported by universities in light of the pandemic. We have been assured that these recommendations will be made available to 
                    higher education institutions imminently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We expect the above concerns and recommendations to be acted upon as a priority, and reasonably expect a response by the 10 July 2020 (two working weeks).
                </p>
                <p>We look forward to your swift response.</p>
